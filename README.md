📁 Project Structure

🚀 How to Run (Local Preview)
Option 1: Direct open

Simply double-click home.html to open it in your browser.

Option 2: Start a local server (recommended)

If you have Python installed:

python -m http.server 8000

Then open:
http://localhost:8000/home.html

This gives more accurate behavior than opening files with file://.
